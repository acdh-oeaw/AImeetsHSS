## **How does it work?**

Luckily, all means of public transportation within the city limits can be used with the same ticket:

* Underground ("U-Bahn")
* Urban Railways ("S-Bahn")
* Tramway
* Bus

Even a single ticket allows (multiple) connections, but no return trips.

## **Where do I get a ticket?**

Various types of tickets are sold at tobacconists ("Trafik"), at vending machines in underground and S-Bahn stations and in some hotels. Even though there are also other options, it is highly recommended that you buy the ticket before you enter the means of transportation.

There are several types of tickets:

* Single ticket (2.40 Euros)
* flexible 7-day ticket (19.70)
* Various tickets valid for a day or more

Please refer to the [public transportation website (Wiener Linien)](https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en) for details on those kind of tickets.
