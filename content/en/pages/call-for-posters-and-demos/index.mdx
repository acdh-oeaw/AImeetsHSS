## Call for Presentations

We invite submissions for posters and live demonstrations to be presented during the conference.

Submissions are expected to present applications of AI-based methods and tools in Humanities and Social Science projects. This can cover various stages of the research cycle from the formulation of a research question, digitisation, processing, structuring, visualisation and analysis of data up to their publication and presentation of results.  

The submissions will be reviewed by the organising committee. Accepted posters and demonstrations will be presented during a common dedicated session concurring with an afternoon reception in the Aula of the Academy. Boards for posters, power outlets, as well as side-tables for materials will be provided.

**Abstracts** for both posters and live demonstrations should not exceed **500 words**, excluding title and references and must be submitted as PDF documents via the form on this page.

Deadline for submissions: 11 April 2025.

Notification of acceptance is until 25 May 2025.
