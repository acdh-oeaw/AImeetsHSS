**Ferenc Zamolyi** (IMFAO, ÖAW)\
Ferenc Zamolyi studied Architecture at the TU Wien (Technical University Vienna), Austria and graduated there in 2004. From 2005 to 2014: Visual Artist, 3D-modelling specialist and graphic artist at the company 7Reasons. Tasks: production of short films, images and reconstructions for museum exhibitions. Worked on material for exhibitions in: Wien-Museum, Römermuseum Wien, Museum Carnuntum and Keltenmuseum Hallein. Works from 2017 on at the Austrian Academy of Sciences as Technical Assistant. Fields of expertise are analysis and interpretation of 3D-scan data and pointclouds, drafting of technical plans of archaeological excavations and monuments, 3d reconstructions and plans for construction research. Involved in following topics and projects: Early- and Middle Byzanthinian architecture (Episcopal quarter in Side), Coptic monastic architecture in Egypt (Theban Monastery of St Paulos, Deir el Bachit, 5th – 10th century AD), Roman architecture (2nd century Ostia), provincial architecture in Pannonia and Noricum, early Christian churches (Burgbichl in Irschen, Carinthia).

The researched vernacular buildings are mostly, but not exclusively wooden framed buildings. A connected research topic is the use and typology of traditional building tools connected to the construction process of such wooden buildings.
