The conference will begin in the early **afternoon of Monday, 23rd June 2025**, with the opening ceremony and the first plenary. The conference runs through **Wednesday, 25th June 2025,** ending with a panel discussion (open for general public) in the later afternoon.

The three-day conference combines different presentation and exchange formats, which are filled with internal OeAW contributions and inputs from invited **speakers**. The first two conference days are dedicated to the discussion of use cases on AI-supported basic research from the Humanities and Social Sciences, which concern different stages of a research cycle, from the formulation of a research question to the generation (“digitization”), processing and structuring of data to their analysis and finally to the presentation of results, visualizations or publications and making the data and results available.

In addition, there will be alternative conference formats in the form of [**posters and live demonstrations**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/conference/ai-meets-hss/en/registration-submission/), which should contribute to more personal and interactive exchange based on exemplary use cases from ongoing or planned projects of the OeAW institutes and commissions.

The third day of the conference will be devoted to science policy reflection on the general impact of the AI age on science in general and the humanities and social sciences in particular. A final highlight will be the [**panel discussion**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/conference/ai-meets-hss/en/podiumsdiskussion/) “Humanities and Social Sciences in the Age of AI”, to which interested members of the public will also be invited. A detailed program can be viewed here soon.
